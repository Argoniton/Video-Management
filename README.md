# Parse Liked Videos from Youtube Page
That is an application which pulls my liked videos on youtube and creates xml file with information about them.
Xml file will contain video title, publisher, length and url link to the video.

I gathered this program into a singe app: 'Parse Liked Videos from Youtube.py'
Alternatively you may run __main__.py
